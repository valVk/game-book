## üé≤ Core Game Mechanics

### Character Stats

Your character has three primary attributes determined by dice rolls:

- **–õ–û–í–ö–û–°–¢–¨ (Agility)**: Combat effectiveness, sword fighting ability, physical dexterity
- **–°–ò–õ–ê (Strength)**: Health points, life force, determination (0 = death)
- **–û–ë–ê–Ø–ù–ò–ï (Charisma)**: Persuasion ability, social skills, negotiation power

### Character Creation Process

1. **Roll 2d6** and consult the stats table to determine your initial attributes
2. **Initialize Luck** by rolling 2d6 and marking those numbers as "used"
3. **Starting Resources**: 15 gold pieces, 3 days of food, a sword, and a 7-slot backpack
4. **Mental Power**: Starts at 3, increases with victories

### Stats Distribution Table

| 2d6 Roll | Agility | Strength | Charisma |
|----------|---------|----------|----------|
| 2        | 8       | 22       | 8        |
| 3        | 10      | 20       | 6        |
| 4        | 12      | 16       | 5        |
| 5        | 9       | 18       | 8        |
| 6        | 11      | 20       | 6        |
| 7        | 9       | 20       | 7        |
| 8        | 10      | 16       | 7        |
| 9        | 8       | 24       | 7        |
| 10       | 9       | 22       | 6        |
| 11       | 10      | 18       | 7        |
| 12       | 11      | 20       | 5        |

## üçÄ Luck System

**Luck** represents fate's favor and provides advantages in critical moments:

- **Initialization**: Roll 2d6 at game start; mark those numbers as "used"
- **Usage**: When prompted to check luck, roll 1d6
  - If the number is available ‚Üí **Lucky** (then mark as used)
  - If already used ‚Üí **Unlucky**
- **Strategy**: Use luck wisely - once spent, it's harder to regain
- **Restoration**: Rare items and events can restore luck points

## ‚öîÔ∏è Combat System

Combat is resolved through opposed dice rolls:

1. **Enemy Attack**: 1d6 √ó 2 + Enemy's Agility = Attack Power
2. **Your Attack**: 1d6 √ó 2 + Your Agility = Attack Power
3. **Resolution**:
   - Higher Attack Power wins and deals **2 Strength damage**
   - Equal Attack Power = blocked, continue fighting
   - Combat continues until someone reaches 0 Strength

## üí¨ Charisma Tests

Social encounters use the Charisma system:

- **Test**: Roll 2d6 vs current Charisma value
- **Success** (roll ‚â§ Charisma): Charisma increases by 1 (max 12)
- **Failure** (roll > Charisma): Charisma decreases by 1 (min 1)
- **Mastery**: At 12 Charisma, automatic success
- **Ruin**: At 1 Charisma, automatic failure

## üéí Resource Management

### Food System
- **Healing**: Each portion restores 4 Strength points
- **Usage**: Can eat anytime except during combat
- **Limitation**: Start with 3 days worth, find more or risk starvation

### Inventory
- **Capacity**: 7-item backpack limit
- **Equipment**: Sword doesn't count (worn in sheath)
- **Strategy**: Choose items wisely, may need to drop things for better finds
